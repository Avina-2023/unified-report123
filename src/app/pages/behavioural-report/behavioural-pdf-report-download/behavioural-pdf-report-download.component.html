            <div class="heading3">Introduction</div>
            <p>This report helps you get a better sense of your behavioural/personality trait. It is a means to provide you with a better understanding of your thoughts, feelings and behaviour in a particular situation. Also, it is essential to understand that all of us are different, and therefore we display different patterns of behaviour. Thus, there is no ideal behavioural/personality trait, as it varies from one person to another. Furthermore, there are no specific guidelines that a person must adhere to, as the requirement may differ according to each individual.</p> 
            <p>The strengths and development scope listed below is a means to understand oneself better, and it could be used as a means to validate your traits.</p>
            <span>Note: Remember that the scores obtained in this assessment are not to be considered absolute; rather, it provides insight regarding your behavioural characteristics, strengths and development.</span>
