                    <p>This report helps you get a better sense of your behavioural/personality trait. It is a means to provide you with a better understanding of your thoughts, feelings and behaviour in a particular situation. Also, it is essential to understand that all of us are different, and therefore we display an array of patterns of behaviour. Thus, there is no ideal behavioural / behavioural / personality trait, as it is contextual. Furthermore, there are no specific guidelines that a person must adhere to, as the requirement may differ according to contextual needs.</p>
                    <p>The strengths and development scope listed below is a means to understand oneself better, and it could be used as a means to validate your traits.</p>
                    <div class="note">Note: Remember that the scores obtained in this assessment are not to be considered absolute rather it provides an insight regarding your attributes along with strengths and development.</div>
